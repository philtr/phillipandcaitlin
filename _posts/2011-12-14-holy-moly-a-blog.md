Yep, that's right! We are a bona fide blogging couple. _Gross,_ you might say. Well, get ready, here we come!

Phillip will be writing about being a husband and (eventually) a father, and offer any tips he runs across along the way (e.g., budgeting, repairs, and other "manly" stuff).

Caitlin will be writing about her endeavors as a housewife, a nanny, and anything else she darn well feels like writing about.

You can learn more [about us](/about-us/), or read the [archives](/archives/) (although there's nothing there yet&mdash;we are just getting started!).
