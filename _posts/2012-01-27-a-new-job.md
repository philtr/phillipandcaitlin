Well, it's time for a change. During my 20 months at [Balcom Agency][balcom], I (Phillip) have had the opportunity to work on interesting projects like [_Dead Sea Scrolls & the Bible_][b/dss] and [Veritas Energy][b/ver]. I'm turning to a new chapter in my life. Starting Monday, I'll be making the trek to Downtown Dallas every day as a developer for [Oven Bits][ovenbits], where I'll be hacking on awesome stuff like [Beyond the Shock][o/bts], [Instead][o/ins], and more!
